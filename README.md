## üöÄ How to Use

Each `.c` file is a standalone program. You can compile and run them individually using a C compiler like `gcc`.

### Prerequisites
You must have a C compiler, such as [GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)](https://gcc.gnu.org/), installed on your system.

### Compilation & Execution

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/souvik123das/C-Language-Projects.git](https://github.com/souvik123das/C-Language-Projects.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the directory:**
    ```sh
    cd C-Language-Projects
    ```

3.  **Compile a program:**
    Use `gcc` to compile the source file. The `-o` flag specifies the name of the output executable.

    ```sh
    # Syntax: gcc -o <output_name> <source_file.c>
    
    # Example:
    gcc -o palindrome palindrome_number.c
    ```

4.  **Run the executable:**
    ```sh
    # Syntax: ./<output_name>
    
    # Example:
    ./palindrome
    ```
